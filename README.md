# Human Activity Recognition using LSTM

This project implements a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks. The model is designed to classify physical activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and more based on motion sensor data collected from smartphones.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Smartphones are equipped with sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can be used to detect human movement patterns. In this project:

- We process time-series sensor data.
- Apply deep learning (LSTM) to recognize patterns in human activity.
- Train and evaluate the model for high-accuracy predictions.
